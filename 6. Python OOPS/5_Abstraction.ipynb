    "Imagine you have a toy robot. It can do many things like walk, talk, and dance. But you don't need to know how it works inside to play with it. You just press a button to make it walk, another button to make it talk, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, think about why you don't need to know how the robot works inside. It's because someone has already figured out how to make it do those things, and they've hidden all the complicated parts inside. All you see are the buttons and actions you can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, abstraction works in a similar way. It's like using a remote control for your toy robot. You don't need to know how the robot's motors, gears, or circuits work inside. You just need to know how to use the remote control to make it do what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in programming means hiding the complex details of how something works and only showing the essential parts that you need to use. It makes it easier to work with complex systems by simplifying the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you use a computer or a smartphone, you don't need to know how the software or hardware inside works in detail. You just need to know how to interact with it using the buttons, touch screen, or voice commands. That's abstraction!\n"

    "#### Understanding Abstract Methods and Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract method is a method that is declared, but does not contain implementation. An abstract method in a base class identifies the functionality that should be implemented by all its subclasses. However, since the implementation of an abstract method would differ from one subclass to another, often the method body comprises just a pass statement. Every subclass of the base class will ride this method with its implementation. A class containing abstract methods is called abstract class.Python provides the abc module to use the abstraction in the Python program,"
